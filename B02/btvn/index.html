                This blog is the official source for the updates from the React
                team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation
                notices, will be posted here first. You can also follow the
                <a href="#">@reactjs</a> account on Twitter, but you won't miss
                anything essential if you only read this blog.

                    React Labs: What We've Been Working On - February 2024

                    In React Labs posts, we write about projects in active
                    research and development. Since our last update, we've made
                    significant progress on React Compiler, new features, and
                    React 19, and we'd like to share what we learned.

                    React Canaries: Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta
                </h2>

                    Traditionally, new React features used to only be available
                    at Meta first, and land in the open source releases later.
                    We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt
                    individual new features as soon as their design is close to
                    finalâ€”similar to how Meta uses React internally. We are
                    introducing a new officially supported Canary release
                    channel. It lets curated setups like frameworks decouple
                    adoption of individual React features from the React release
                    schedule.

                    Today we are thrilled to launch react.dev, the new home for
                    React and its documentation. In this post, we would like to
                    give you a tour of the new site.
